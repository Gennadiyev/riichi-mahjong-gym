# Terminology

Riichi Mahjong originates from the Japanese Mahjong game. Most of the terms are not native English words. Here is the list of the terms we use in the project.

This page also contains the variable naming convention of the project. So if you're not familiar with Japanese, you can check the table here.

## Tiles

### `man`, "万" / "Character"
